Project: 3D-Aware Image Generation with Gaussian Splatting (Name can be re-worked but I'm happy with what I have for now)

Core Concept I want to achieve: Create a system that generates 2D images from text prompts while *maintaining* 3D spatial consistency, then reconstructs them into 3D Gaussian splat representations.
Project Architecture


Phase 1: Enhanced Stable Diffusion Pipeline
- Implement depth-conditioned Stable Diffusion using ControlNet
- Add camera pose conditioning to maintain view consistency
- Generate multi-view images from single text prompts with controlled viewpoints

Phase 2: Gaussian Splatting Integration
- Convert generated images into 3D Gaussian splats using techniques from DreamGaussian or similar methods
Implement differentiable Gaussian splatting for optimization
Use Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to establish initial 3D geometry

Phase 3: Spatial Consistency Optimization
- Apply Gaussian mixture models for spatial regularization
- Implement cross-view consistency losses
- Add temporal coherence for animated sequences

Technical Implementation Stack
Core Libraries I might/will need:
- !!!!diffusers (HuggingFace) for Stable Diffusion
- diff-gaussian-rasterization for 3D Gaussian splatting
- pytorch3d for 3D transformations and rendering
- opencv-python for computer vision operations



Key Components Im thinking to Build:
- Multi-view Generator: Extend SD with camera pose embeddings
- Depth Estimator: Integrate MiDaS or DPT for depth prediction
- Gaussian Optimizer: Implement differentiable splatting with spatial priors
- Consistency Enforcer: Cross-view loss functions using Gaussian kernels


Workflow I'm thinking to starrt with

- Step 1: Input: Very simple text prompt like "a blue car in a driveway" (starting point - this will be made more complex as I learn) ✅
- Step 2: Generation: Create 4-6 viewpoints using pose-conditioned SD
- Step 3: Reconstruction: Initialize Gaussian splats from multi-view stereo
- Step 4: Optimization: Refine splats using photometric and semantic losses
- Step 5: Output: Interactive 3D scene viewable from any angle


How do I determine if I am ready? – Success Metrics
a. Geometric Consistency: LPIPS scores between novel views < 0.15
b. Temporal Stability: Optical flow consistency > 0.8 across frames
c. Semantic Preservation: CLIP similarity with original prompt > 0.25
